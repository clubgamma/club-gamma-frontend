## Community Intent

Our community students aspire to be gentle. This is the leading concept for supervising oneself within community.

## Anticipated Behaviour
The following ways of acting are expected and appealed of all community members:

- Be friendly and patient

This includes, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression immigration status, colour, social and economic class, educational level, mental and physical ability. age, size, family status, political belief and religion.
- We possibly all experience some annoyance now and then, but we cannot allow that annoyance to turn into a personal assault. Not all of us will agree all of the time, but the dispute is no excuse for deprived behaviour and deprived manners. Be respectful. Treat people the way you want to be treated.
- We don't all speak the same speech at the same flair level. Understandable communication can help to avoid misinterpretation. Disagreements, social and technical, are usual, but we expect participants in the community to settle disagreements positively by avoiding: trolling personal attacks monotonous arguments.
- Nobody is expected to be ideal in this community. Questions are uplifted, interrogate questions early evade many problems later. Help each other and be responsive and understanding.
- We are a community of learning executive and we deport ourselves professionally. Be kind to others both within the community and beyond the community. Do not marginalize, insult, minimize, or put down other participants, cultures, or subcultures. Contribute constructively to the learning zone.
