# Nailing Coding Interviews

In our university we are having 800+ students who are in pre-final and final year and will appear for the interview. Students have started to apply for the companies. We are organizing this event to resolve their queries as well as make them aware about what care should be taken while applying in the company and enlightening them about MNCs giving off campus placements and how to approach them. To solve the queries of community's students we will be having Anjali Viramgama, final year student at University of Maryland who is interning at Facebook.
